# SmartContract-Frontend
This project is a decentralized application (DApp) that interacts with a simple smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can connect their Ethereum wallet (e.g., Metamask) to view and manipulate the contract's integer value through a user-friendly web interface built using React.
